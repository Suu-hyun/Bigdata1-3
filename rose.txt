Call us what we are
Toxic from the start
Can't pretend that I was in the dark 
When you met my friends
Didn't even try with them
I should've known it then that you were 

Jealous and possessive 
So manipulating 
Honestly impressive
You had me participating 

Back then
When I was running out of your place 
I said
I never wanna see your face
And then
I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic till the end 

Uh huh
Cuz even when I said it was over
You heard Baby can you pull me in closer 
You were
Plotting how to stay in my head
We were toxic till the end 

Ladies & Gentleman
I present to you, the ex 

His favorite game is chess
Who would ever guess
Playing with the pieces in my chest
Now he's on the screen
Saying don't leave
You stole that line from me
Cuz you're just 

Jealous and possessive 
So manipulating 
Honestly impressive
You had me participating 

Back then
When I was running out of your place 
I said
I never wanna see your face
I meant
I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic till the end 

Uh huh
Cuz even when I said it was over
You heard Baby can you pull me in closer 
You were
Plotting how to stay in my head
We were toxic till the end 

End end 

I can forgive you for a lot of things
For not giving me back my Tiffany rings 
I'll never forgive you for one thing my dear 
You wasted my prettiest years 

Back then
When I was running out of your place 
I said
I never wanna see your face
I meant
I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic 

Uh huh
Cuz even when I said it was over
You heard Baby can you pull me in closer 
You were
Plotting how to stay in my head
We were toxic till the end 

End end
We were toxic till the end
End end

We're at a crossroad
And we don't know which way to go 
Part of me lost hope
And part of me just can't let go 

We said we'd cross those bridges when they came 
Now it's time to give it a name
Yeah we're at a crossroad 

So baby let me know 

Do I call you my ex
Or do I call you my boyfriend
Call you a lover, do I call you a friend 
Call you the one or the one that got away 
Someone I'll just have to forget
Do I call you every night you're gone
Or never call you again
Do we have a future
Or should I call it the end 

We were a moment
And you were my only true oasis 
Now all those oceans
Are falling down our faces
So if we don't see it through
I'm a better me because of you 
Yeah we're at a crossroad 

So baby let me know 

Do I call you my ex
Or do I call you my boyfriend
Call you a lover, do I call you a friend 
Call you the one or the one that got away 
Someone I'll just have to forget
Do I call you every night you're gone
Or never call you again
Do we have a future
Or should I call it the end
Should I call it the end 
Are we lovers or friends 
Cause it's as good as it gets 
Should I call it the end

Eh eh eh eh eh eh 

I just saw a red flag
Gonna pretend I didn't see that 
Cuz is it really really that bad? 
I need you really really that bad 

So can we keep the story rolling
Forget that s*** my mother always told me 
Cuz nothing's really perfect like that
I need you really really that bad
I need you really really that bad 

The one I run to
Take my makeup off and say goodnight to
The one I pretty talk and ugly cry to
The world can roll their eyes but there's no use 
I just want it to be you
When it's 3am
I'm losing myself and my mind again
The one who gives me love that is bullet proof 
The world can roll their eyes but there's no use 
I just want it to be you
Eh eh eh eh eh eh
I just want it to be you
Eh eh eh eh eh eh
I just want it to be you 

Hold me
Kiss me on my face
Talk s*** about the world with me all day
And even when I'm putting you through hell 
Say I'm not like anyone else
Slowly words roll off my tongue
You're everything I need and it's so dumb
And even when you're putting me through hell 
You're not like anyone else 

I wanna run to
Take my makeup off and say goodnight to
The one I pretty talk and ugly cry to
The world can roll their eyes but there's no use 
I just want it to be you
When it's 3am
And I'm losing myself and my mind again 
The one who gives me love that is bullet proof 
The world can roll their eyes but there's no use 
I just want it to be you
Eh eh eh eh eh eh
I just want it to be you
Eh eh eh eh eh eh
I just want it to be you
Eh eh eh eh eh eh
I just want it to be you
Eh eh eh eh eh eh
I just want it to be you

How'd it all fall apart
You were right here before, in my arms 
Now you're invisible
But the heartbreak's physical 

Got a place, moved away
Somewhere with a different code, different state 
Still feels miserable
God it's so chemical 

All that I know
Is I can't let you go 
It's been two years and you're still not gone 
It doesn't make sense that I can't move on 
Yeah I try, I try, I try, I try
But this love never dies 

Two years since you've been in my bed 
Even had a funeral for you in my head 
Yeah I try, I try, I try, I try
But this love never dies 

Another night, another vice
Even try with someone new, someone nice
I'll always hate the fact that you, ruined everybody after you 
I'm always coming back to you 

It's been two years and you're still not gone 
It doesn't make sense that I can't move on 
Yeah I try, I try, I try, I try
But this love never dies 

It's been two years since you've been in my bed 
Even had a funeral for you in my head
Yeah I try, I try, I try, I try
But this love never dies 

Maybe I'm just sick and this is how it's gonna be 
Maybe this is all I know
And I know it's not you it's me 

Cuz it's been two years and you're still not gone 
It doesn't make sense that I can't move on
Yeah I try, I try, I try, I try
But this love never dies 

It's been two years since you've been in my bed 
Even had a funeral for you in my head
Yeah I try, I try, I try, I try
But this love never dies

Standing in the corner
Of a crowded place
This is boring
Till I heard your name
And now I'm staying for ya
We're just friends it's okay
Kinda weird how my night changed 

Is it just me
Starting to see
You in a different light
I know we can't say what we mean 
But I'm happy that you're here tonight 

I'm feeling so good
At a bad party
We don't have to talk
I know that you want me 
Gotta keep it nice 
We cannot be naughty 
We can get drinks
Or we could get coffee 

Feeling so good
At a bad party
We don't have to talk
I know that you want me 
Gotta keep it nice
We cannot be naughty 
We can get drinks
Or we could get coffee 

Is it so wrong
I've been thinking bout you
All day, yesterday, and today and tomorrow 
Is it so wrong
I've been bending the truth
All day, yesterday, and today and tomorrow 

Is it just me
Starting to see
You in a different light 
I know we can't say what we mean 
But you know that I mean it right 

I'm feeling so good
At a bad party
We don't have to talk

If crying was fun
I'll be having the time of my life
If loving you was a jump
Yeah I probably died a hundred ten times 

Gave you my favorite memories 
Yeah I hate the way I let you inside 
Just so you could take it for granted 
Two years, now I understand it 

Yeah you'll always be a gameboy 
These days I don't wanna play boy 
Say say what you wanna say 
You're never gonna change 
You'll only ever be a heartbreak, heartbreak 
Yeah you'll only ever be a heartbreak, heartbreak 

Yeah you got a little too good acting like a good guy
And I bought it for a minute but isn't what you made it look like 
Yeah you got a cute face, and that kept me entertained
And the way you say my name
Won't lie it felt amazing
But you took my love for granted
And it took me two years to understand it 

Yeah you'll always be a gameboy 
These days I don't wanna play boy 
Say say what you wanna say 
You're never gonna change 
You'll only ever be a heartbreak 

Yeah you'll always be a gameboy 
All day keep me on the chase boy 
Say say what you wanna say 
You're never gonna change 
You'll only ever be a heartbreak
 
Shame on me should've known better 
I let you play me whatever 
Something's just ain't meant to be 
Kinda like you and me, yeah yeah 

Thought you would love me forever 
I should've known you would never 
Something's just ain't meant to be 
Kinda like you and me 

Yeah you'll always be a game boy 
These days I don't wanna play boy 
Say say what you wanna say 
You're never gonna change 
You'll only ever be a heartbreak 

Yeah you'll always be a gameboy
All day keep me on the chase boy
Say say what you wanna say
You're never gonna change
You'll only ever be a heartbreak, heartbreak 
Only ever be a heartbreak, heartbreak

Stay a little longer
Take a little longer
To pack up your bags 
You're moving too fast 
Make me want to hate you 
So I don't have to miss you 
Oh make a mistake 
So someone's to blame 

I can't stand these four walls without you inside them 
Build us a castle, then leave me in silence
What if I tangled some rope 'round your feet
Into the ocean, cause I'm in too deep 

Please won't you stay, stay a little longer babe 
Don't walk away, when I'm here calling your name 
I'm fragile
I'm speechless
Don't leave me in pieces
Already having enough trouble breathing
Please won't you stay, stay a little longer babe 

Walk a little slower 
Stand a little closer
So I can convince you 
The minute I kiss you 
Speak a little softer
So I don't have to answer 
And make it okay 
Before you can say 

I can't stand these four walls without you inside them 
Build us a castle, then leave me in silence
What if I tangled some rope 'round your feet
Into the ocean, cause I'm in too deep 

Please won't you stay, stay a little longer babe 
I'll be okay, you say it's written all over my face
I'm fragile
I'm speechless
Don't leave me in pieces
Already having enough trouble breathing 

Please won't you stay, stay a little longer babe, oh 
Babe 

Stay a little longer
Take a little longer
To pack up your bags 
You're moving too fast 
Make me wanna hate you 
So I don't have to miss you
Oh make a mistake 
So someone's to blame 

Please won't you stay, stay a little longer babe 
I'll be okay, you say it's written all over my face 
I'm fragile
I'm speechless
Don't leave me in pieces
Already having enough trouble breathing
Please won't you stay, stay a little longer babe

Say what you want to babe
You know that you talking in circles 
Tell me lies
Like we ok
Promise til' your face turns purple 

That you gon love me, love me 
One day you gon love me, right 
Shame on me for trusting you once 
Trusting you twice 

Yeah we had
Only and nothing but time
But some things just change overnight
I don't know who you think you're kiddin babe 
Yeah you're not the same
Not the same 

Yeah we had
Good days and light on our side
But you f***** up and you know I'm right
I don't know who you think you're kiddin babe 
Yeah you're not the same
Not the same
Not the same 

Pick it up, up
Drop your keys come and get your stuff yeah 
Find a new heart to confide in
Did letting me down get tiring? 

I keep on walking through all of the memories that I had with you 
And I don't miss it
The way you broke my love 

Yeah we had
Only and nothing but time
But some things just change overnight
I don't know who you think you're kiddin babe 
Yeah you're not the same
Not the same 

Yeah we had
Good days and light on our side
But you fucked up and you know that I'm right 
I don't know who you think you're kiddin babe 
You're not the same
Not the same
Not the same 

Oh what a shame
Nothing's the same
All of my love you put it to waste 
And you can keep pointing the finger 
Thought it'd be us go figure 

Yeah we had
Only and nothing but time
But some things just change overnight
I don't know who you think you're kiddin babe 
Yeah you're not the same
Not the same 

Yeah we had
Good days and light on our side
But you f***** up and you know that I'm right 
I don't know who you think you're kiddin babe 
You're not the same
Not the same
Not the same 

And it crept up on us
In the way that it does
And the moment disappeared
In the desert of us
All our tears turned to dust
Now the roses don't grow here
I guess that love does what it wants 
And that's just too bad for us 

Was it all just slight of hand
Another trick that fate has played on us again 
Two heads in the sand
I hear you talkin but I just can't understand 

Caught in no man's land 
Between the wires 
Comin under friendly fire 
Can't go forward 
Can't go back again 

And it crept up on us
In the way that it does
And the moment disappeared
In the desert of us
All our tears turned to dust
Now the roses don't grow here
I guess that love does what it wants 
And that's just too bad for us 

Flying high with both eyes closed
Almost touched the sun I guess we got too close 
Now I'm dancing on my own
But the music's not as good when you're alone 

Caught in no man's land 
Between the wires 
Comin under friendly fire 
Can't go forward 
Can't go back again 

And it crept up on us
In the way that it does 
And the moment disappeared
In the desert of us
All our tears turned to dust
Now the roses don't grow here
I guess that love does what it wants 
And that's just too bad for us 

We wanna talk but we don't wanna listen
We play pretend but we both know it's missin 
If love burns too bright it burns out in a minute 
At least that's what I tell myself 

We wanna talk but we don't wanna listen
We play pretend but we both know it's missin 
If love burns too bright it burns out in a minute 
At least that's what I tell myself 

And it crept up on us
In the way that it does
And the moment disappeared
In the desert of us
All our tears turned to dust
Now the roses don't grow here
I guess that love does what it wants 
And that's just too bad for us
